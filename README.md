## Background

There is a small effort you have to pay if you already have a shopping plan and you already now when  you have to prepare which meal. It also is less time and cost consuming.

Getting to know a new framework can be exhausting but also be fun if you have a project to maintain. So this projects was born.

## Recipies

Hey, I'm already learning to code so don't trust my recipies at the beginning.
With time I will put more recipes online, which I have already cooked and found good. These will be copied from cookbooks, magazines or from acquaintances.
